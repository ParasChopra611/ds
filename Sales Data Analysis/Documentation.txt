1] Merging/combining all data files into a single data file
2] Droping Completely null rows. { using df.dropna(how='all') }




---] ANALYSIS - here we will answer some questions & explore the reasoning behind it
	
	Q1] What was the best & worst month of sales?? How much was earned at those month??
	
		Split 'Order Date' column into 4 columns - Order Month,order Date,Order Year, Time{use split()}
	
	Q2] Which State had highest & lowest sales ?? How much was earned at those states
		
		Again use split() for extracting locality, city, state, zip code from 'Purchase Address' Column.	
		
	Q3] Which city had highest & lowest sales?? How much was earned there??

	Q4] Which time period sees the most sales - Morning, Afternoon or evening?? 
			
			
			Classify the values in 'Time' column [created in Q1] in these categories
			
			Morning is from sunrise to 11:59 AM. Sunrise typically occurs around 6 AM.
			Afternoon is from 12:01 PM to around 5:00 PM.
			Evening is from 5:01 PM to 8 PM, or around sunset.
			Night is from sunset to sunrise, so from 8:01 PM until 5:59 AM.
			
			1st split the 'Time' column into hour & min cols
				if hour in range[6 , 12]  => Morning
				if hour in range[12 , 17] => afternoon
				if hour in range[17 , 20] => evening
				if hour in range[20 , 24] => night
			
			
	Q5] Which product was sold the most?? How much??
			here we will see the Quantity sold for each item [NOT Sales]
			
	
	Q6] Which items are 'sold together' the most	??
		These are the items with same order ID. Whichever items whose Order ID are same are sold together to a single person at the same time
		
		eg 
			OrderID		Product			Quantity
			22			Item A			3
			22			Item B			4
			23			Item C			5
			23			Item D			1
			24			Item E			2
			24			item A			7
			
		New Dataset
			OrderID		Product			Quantity
			22			ItemA,ItemB		3+4
			23			item C,Item D	5+1
			24			item E,Item A	2+7
			
		In this way we make a new dataset that contains the combi of items that are being sold together along with their resp. quantities.  	
		
		
---] MY OWN ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

	QQ1] How many unique orders were registered in each hour?? Which hour interval sees the most orders??
			
			Hint - no of unique orders  = no of unique order ids
